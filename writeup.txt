Our strategy is a random strategy. We wait a bit in the beginning until we get 50 paint buckets in order to color after others paint, thereby increasing the chance of painting over their tiles.

Currently, we do pick up powerups. We try to use them when possible. However, we do not always pick up powerups, and we do not always use them.
